<h1>Term Deposit Subscription Prediction</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project aims to predict whether clients of a retail banking institution will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal information and details of previous marketing campaigns. The model will help the bank target customers more effectively through telephonic marketing campaigns, thereby optimizing their investment in call centers.</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The bank needs to identify clients who are most likely to subscribe to term deposits, using data from past campaigns and client information. By predicting these potential subscribers, the bank can focus their telemarketing efforts on high-probability clients, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.</p>

<h2>Data Description</h2>
<p>The dataset includes client information, details of the marketing campaigns, and whether the client subscribed to a term deposit. The key variables are:</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>ID</code>: Unique client ID</li>
    <li><code>age</code>: Age of the client</li>
    <li><code>job</code>: Type of job</li>
    <li><code>marital</code>: Marital status of the client</li>
    <li><code>education</code>: Education level</li>
    <li><code>default</code>: Credit in default</li>
    <li><code>housing</code>: Housing loan</li>
    <li><code>loan</code>: Personal loan</li>
    <li><code>contact</code>: Type of communication</li>
    <li><code>month</code>: Contact month</li>
    <li><code>day_of_week</code>: Day of week of contact</li>
    <li><code>duration</code>: Contact duration</li>
    <li><code>campaign</code>: Number of contacts performed during this campaign to the client</li>
    <li><code>pdays</code>: Number of days since the client was last contacted</li>
    <li><code>previous</code>: Number of contacts performed before this campaign</li>
    <li><code>poutcome</code>: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign</li>
    <li><code>subscribed</code>: Target variable indicating if the client subscribed to a term deposit</li>
</ul>

<h2>Evaluation Metric</h2>
<p>The evaluation metric for this project is accuracy.</p>

<h2>Steps Involved</h2>

<h3>1. Data Loading and Exploration</h3>
<p>Load the datasets and explore them to understand the structure and identify any missing values.</p>

<h3>2. Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize or scale features if necessary.</p>

<h3>3. Train-Test Split</h3>
<p>Split the training data into training and validation sets to evaluate model performance.</p>

<h3>4. Model Selection and Training</h3>
<p>Choose a classification model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier) and train it on the training set. Evaluate the model on the validation set using accuracy.</p>

<h3>5. Predict on Test Data</h3>
<p>Use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset.</p>

<h3>6. Save Predictions</h3>
<p>Save the predictions in the required format for submission.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>The final model achieved a validation accuracy of <code>0.908802713</code> and was used to predict term deposit subscriptions for the test dataset.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem in the banking sector. By accurately predicting potential term deposit subscribers, the bank can optimize its marketing efforts and improve its overall efficiency.</p>

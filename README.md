Term Deposit Subscription Prediction
<br>
Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether clients of a retail banking institution will subscribe to a term deposit based on their personal information and details of previous marketing campaigns. The model will help the bank target customers more effectively through telephonic marketing campaigns, thereby optimizing their investment in call centers.

Problem Statement
The bank needs to identify clients who are most likely to subscribe to term deposits, using data from past campaigns and client information. By predicting these potential subscribers, the bank can focus their telemarketing efforts on high-probability clients, reducing costs and increasing efficiency.

Data Description
The dataset includes client information, details of the marketing campaigns, and whether the client subscribed to a term deposit. The key variables are:

ID: Unique client ID
age: Age of the client
job: Type of job
marital: Marital status of the client
education: Education level
default: Credit in default
housing: Housing loan
loan: Personal loan
contact: Type of communication
month: Contact month
day_of_week: Day of week of contact
duration: Contact duration
campaign: Number of contacts performed during this campaign to the client
pdays: Number of days since the client was last contacted
previous: Number of contacts performed before this campaign
poutcome: Outcome of the previous marketing campaign
subscribed: Target variable indicating if the client subscribed to a term deposit
Evaluation Metric
The evaluation metric for this project is accuracy.

Steps Involved
Data Loading and Exploration:

Load train.csv and test.csv datasets.
Explore the datasets to understand the structure and identify missing values.
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Encode categorical variables using Label Encoding.
Normalize or scale features if necessary.
Train-Test Split:

Split the training data into training and validation sets.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose a classification model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier).
Train the model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the validation set using accuracy.
Prediction on Test Data:

Predict the target variable on the test dataset.
Save Predictions:

Save the predictions in the required format for submission.
Results
The final model achieved a validation accuracy of [your_accuracy_score] and was used to predict term deposit subscriptions for the test dataset.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a real-world business problem in the banking sector. By accurately predicting potential term deposit subscribers, the bank can optimize its marketing efforts and improve its overall efficiency.
